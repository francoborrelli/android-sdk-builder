This repository contains a Dockerfile and associated configurations to facilitate the build and generation of APK files for Android applications. By using Docker containers, developers can create a standardized build environment, eliminating dependency issues and ensuring consistent builds across different systems.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with building Android apps using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/francoborrelli/android-sdk-builder.git

   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image:**
   ```
   docker build -t android-build .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container:**
   ```
   docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace android-build
   ```

4. **Retrieve the APK File:**
   Once the build process is complete, the generated APK file will be available in the `/workspace` directory within the Docker container. You can copy it to your host machine using the `docker cp` command.
